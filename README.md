# CssSlider
Going through my web dev journey, I sometimes have found it difficult to implement some javascript at the begining. Feeling confortable with CSS i decided to go forward with the implementation of javascript stuffs just with css. 
This consequently gave rise to the Js/CSS war which i just joined. The Slider/Carousel looks like this:

Let's make this **#opensource**, fork, issues, comments and PR are all awaited and of course fully welcomed. I'll like to be disturbed :) !
